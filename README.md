# Dalvik16
A project to provide a native C wrapper to enable the running of Java bytecode applications of microcontroller devices.

Various projects both closed and open source have previously been or are currently being carried out to develop Virtual Machines for resource-constrained microcontroller systems.
These however, mainly use Java bytecode.
The scope of this project was the development of such a Virtual Machine for Dalvik bytecode.
